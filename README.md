# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are a great way to compile the needs of the user into a document. Being able to prioritze and categorize the stories by size can help to work effeciently.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to incorporate the Scrum-agile process into developing programs in the future. Scrum benefits with it's focus on teamwork and collaboration as well as its review phases. I beleive the Scrum-agile methodology is an efficient software development lifecycle process.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member means being able to work well with others and having good communication skills. Being a good team member should mean you are an easy person to approach and talk to if someone has a problem, but also be able to ask for help. A good listener is another trait of a good team member.
